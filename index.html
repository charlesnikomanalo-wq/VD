  <p>I know it’s been a long time since we’ve truly talked, but I’ve realized that keeping my thoughts to myself wasn't helping me move forward. To be honest, you’re still someone who crosses my mind every day. I still care for you deeply, and I think I’ve found it hard to let go simply because of the person you are. You’ve had such a big impact on my life and you’ve truly changed me for the better.</p>

  <p>I’ve spent many nights replaying everything in my head, looking back at my actions with a lot of regret but also with a lot of clarity. I realize now where I fell short and how my past self didn't always give you what you deserved. Being classmates has been bittersweet it's a constant reminder of what I lost, but it’s also given me the space to watch you and appreciate your drive from a distance while I worked on my own.</p>

  <p>Speaking of drive, I want you to know that I haven’t forgotten what I said. I’m still working hard on that promise I made to surpass your general average. It might sound small to some, but it’s been a huge motivation for me to stay focused and prove to myself and to you that I can be the person I said I’d be. It’s one of the ways I’m trying to show that I’ve grown and that I’m taking my future, and the lessons I learned from us, seriously.</p>

  <p>I want you to know that the person I am today isn't the same person from eight months ago. I’ve learned how to be more thoughtful and understanding. I’m not saying this to rush you or to disrupt your peace, but I believe some things are worth the wait.</p>

  <p>The silence between us has been one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to navigate, but I also think it was necessary. It forced me to look at my life and my character without the comfort of having you by my side. I’ve realized that my love for you isn’t just a feeling it’s a commitment to being better. That’s why I’m okay with waiting because the version of me that eventually stands before you needs to be someone you can truly rely on and be proud of.</p>

  <p>I know that Valentine's Day can feel heavy when things are complicated, but I didn't want the day to pass without you knowing how much you are valued. Whether we’re talking or just sharing the same classroom, your presence still makes an impact on everyone around you, especially me. My only hope for today is that you feel genuinely appreciated and happy, because if anyone deserves to feel that way, it’s you.</p>

  <p>I'm focused on my own path for now, but I truly believe some things are worth the wait. Once we’ve both graduated and moved into the next chapter, I hope we can find the chance to talk again and maybe even start over with a fresh perspective and a lot more maturity.</p>

  <p>Happy Valentine’s Day. I hope today brings you happiness and reminds you that someone cares deeply for you. </p>
  <p>P.S. I hope we can still be okay when we see each other in school. I didn’t send this to put any pressure on you or make things weird I just wanted to get these thoughts off my chest. I’m happy just seeing you do your thing from a distance.<br><span class="from">-Niko</span></p>
